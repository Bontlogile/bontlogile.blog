          <p>Have you ever been in trouble, feeling hopeless, and suddenly having a stranger show 
            up to help you—just like that? 
            That unexpected kindness feels like a lifeline, reminding us that goodness still exists even in 
            this broken world. </p>
            <p>This kind of love, shown without expectation, reflects the very love described in John 3:16.
            In this verse, God's love isn't distant or conditional. It's a powerful, sacrificial love that moves Him 
            to give His only Son, Jesus, for people He had never met before, and whom He invites to receive His gift 
            of eternal life. Just like the stranger who helps us when we least expect it, God's love reaches out to every 
            person in the world, no matter who they are or where they come from.
            It's a free gift.
          
           <h4>John 3:16</h4>
          </p>  
            "For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life."
