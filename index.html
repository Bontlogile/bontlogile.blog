          Have you ever been in trouble, feeling hopeless, and suddenly having a
          stranger show up to help you—just like that? That unexpected kindness
          feels like a lifeline, reminding us that goodness still exists even in
          this broken world.
        </p>

        <p>
          This kind of love, shown without expectation, reflects the very love
          described in John 3:16. In this verse, God's love isn't distant or
          conditional. It's a powerful, sacrificial love that moves Him to give
          His only Son, Jesus, for people He had never met before, and whom He
          invites to receive His gift of eternal life. Just like the stranger
          who helps us when we least expect it, God's love reaches out to every
          person in the world, no matter who they are or where they come from.
          It's a free gift.

          "For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so
          that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal
          life."
