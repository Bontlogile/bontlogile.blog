        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      It not about calculating every ratio imaginable; its about calculating a
      ratio that would help the user get to an informed decision.
      </p>

      <p>
      The user could want the ratio anlalysis to make an informed decision based
      on the profitability, liquidity, gearing and investment returns of an organisation. 
      </p>

      <p class="Example">For Example:
        <ul>
          <li class="Example heading">Profitability</li>
          <li class="Example heading">Liquidity</li>
          <li class="Example heading">Gearing</li>
          <li class="Example heading">Returns on investment</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    
      <p>Take note that most measures will not mean much on their own, and can only be useful when compared with something. This comparison could be against previous years of the same company, with those of similar company or against industry averages.</p>

                <li>Stagnent EPS may signal underlying issues like...</li>
                <li>A significant difference between basic EPS and diluted EPS can indicate pontetial risks that the comapny's profitability per share may decline if dilutive securities (e.g convertible bonds, stock options or warrants) are converted into shares.</li>
