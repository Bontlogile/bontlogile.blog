      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>
        The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the framework within which
        financial managers operate, and to identify the main areas where they
        have to make decisions.
      </p>

      <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        There are many types of organisations and many different groups that
        have a stake in the performance of the organisations. <br />
      </p>

      <p>These groups include:</p>


      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shareholders</li>
          <li>
          The community at large (in particular, environmental considerations)
          </li>
          <li>Employees of the company</li>
          <li>Managers / directors of the company</li>
          <li>Customers</li>
          <li>Suppliers</li>
          <li>Finance providers (lenders)</li>
          <li>The government</li>
        </ul>
      </p> 

      <p>The interests of all stakeholders need to be balanced.</p>

      <p>
        In the UK (and the USA) the focus is on the shareholders, on the basis
        that it is the shareholders that have a risk and return relationship
        with the company. The aim is to maximise shareholders' wealth
        (maximising) while at the same time satisfying the requirements of the
        other stakeholders (satisficing).
      </p>

      <p>
        In many countries of mainland Europe, and Japan, the focus is more on
        maximising corporate wealth which includes technical, human and market
        resources.
